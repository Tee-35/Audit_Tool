***Q1,Q2‑Review: Game Shop Sales Report Jan-Jun 2025***

Play Hub is an online retailer specialising in gaming consoles and IT equipment, offering products such as PlayStation 5 consoles, AirPods, and Google Pixel devices. This analysis focused on sales performance for the first half of 2025, using Python with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to uncover purchasing trends and operational insights. Based on these findings, projections were developed for the second half of the year to guide stock planning, marketing strategies, and revenue optimisation. The review demonstrates how data-driven insights can support stronger business performance.

### Total Sales

The analysis of total sales by product for the first two quarters of 2025 shows that the MacBook Air, iPhone 15, and Google Pixel 8 generated the highest revenue, together accounting for a significant share of overall sales. In contrast, accessories and lower-priced items such as the Kindle Paperwhite and AirPods contributed less to total revenue. These trends suggest strong customer demand for premium devices, indicating that Play Hub should prioritise stocking high-value tech products and maintaining healthy inventory levels for top-performing models. For the remainder of 2025, focusing on replenishing fast-moving, high-margin items while monitoring emerging trends in gaming consoles and accessories could help optimise sales and warehouse efficiency.

The monthly order analysis for the first half of 2025 shows steady growth from January to March, peaking sharply in April with nearly 2,000 orders, before declining through May and June. This spike may indicate a seasonal promotion, new product launch, or increased marketing activity driving sales in April. The downward trend in subsequent months suggests potential overstocking risks or reduced customer engagement post-peak. To prepare for the second half of 2025, Play Hub should plan inventory and marketing strategies around similar high-demand periods while investigating the causes behind the mid-year decline to stabilise future order volumes.

The data shows that Manchester led total orders in the first half of the year (27%), followed by London (21%) and Glasgow (17%), while other regions collectively made up 35%. This distribution highlights consistent demand in major cities with strong growth potential across smaller markets.  

Looking ahead, warehouse stocking should prioritize maintaining sufficient inventory for Manchester and London while expanding product availability in high-performing smaller regions. A deeper analysis of purchasing patterns — such as peak order months and popular product categories — can guide inventory planning and promotional strategies. Consider offering bundle deals or seasonal promotions aligned with buying trends to boost mid-year sales and optimize stock turnover.
